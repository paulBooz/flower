**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized learning technique that enables participating devices to collaboratively build a shared Machine Leaning (ML) or Deep Learning (DL) model without revealing their raw data to a third party. Due to its privacy-preserving nature, FL has sparked widespread attention for building Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) within the realm of cybersecurity. However, the data heterogeneity across participating domains and entities presents significant challenges for the reliable implementation of an FL-based IDS. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Statistical Averaging (StatAvg) to alleviate non-independently and identically (non-iid) distributed features across local clients' data in FL. In particular, StatAvg allows the FL clients to share their individual data statistics with the server, which then aggregates this information to produce global statistics. The latter are shared with the clients and used for universal data normalisation. It is worth mentioning that StatAvg can seamlessly integrate with any FL aggregation strategy, as it occurs before the actual FL training process. The proposed method is evaluated against baseline approaches using datasets for network and host Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered IDS. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of StatAvg in mitigating non-iid feature distributions across the FL clients compared to the baseline methods.


## About this baseline

**Whatâ€™s implemented:** The code in this directory replicates the experiments in the above paper for TON IoT datasets, which proposed the StatAvg algorithm. It replicates the Figure 3 of the paper.

**Datasets:** TON IoT dataset (linux memory logs). Online at https://research.unsw.edu.au/projects/toniot-datasets

**Hardware Setup:**  These experiments were run on a desktop machine with 16 CPU threads. Any machine with 4 CPU cores or more would be able to run it in a reasonable amount of time

**Contributors:** TBD


## Experimental Setup

**Task:** Classification of cyberattacks

**Model:** A simple MLP with three hidden layers.

**Dataset:** This baseline only includes the TON IoT dataset. By default, it will be partitioned into 5 clients following a stratified split based on the labels. The settings are as follows:
| Dataset | #classes | #partitions | partitioning method | partition settings |
| :------ | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| TON IoT | 6 | 5 | stratified based on labels | 6 classes per client |

**Training Hyperparameters:** The following table shows the main hyperparameters for this baseline with their default value
| Description | Default Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| total clients | 5 |
| clients per round | 5 |
| number of rounds | 50 |
| client resources | {'num_cpus': 3.0, 'num_gpus': 0.0 }|
| data partition | stratified based on class (6 classes per client) |
| optimizer | Adam |


## Environment Setup

To construct the Python environment, simply run:

```bash
# Set directory to use python 3.10 (install with `pyenv install <version>` if you don't have it)
pyenv local 3.10.13

# Tell poetry to use python3.10
poetry env use 3.10.13

# Install
poetry install
```

## Running the Experiments

To run StatAvg with TON IoT baseline, first ensure you have activated your Poetry environment (execute `poetry shell` from this directory), then:

```bash
python -m statavg.main # this will run using the default settings in the `conf/config.yaml`

# you can override settings directly from the command line
python -m statavg.main num_rounds=20 # will set number of rounds to 20
```

## Expected Results

:warning: _Your baseline implementation should replicate several of the experiments in the original paper. Please include here the exact command(s) needed to run each of those experiments followed by a figure (e.g. a line plot) or table showing the results you obtained when you ran the code. Below is an example of how you can present this. Please add command followed by results for all your experiments._

```bash
# it is likely that for one experiment you need to sweep over different hyperparameters. You are encouraged to use Hydra's multirun functionality for this. This is an example of how you could achieve this for some typical FL hyperparameteres

poetry run python -m <baseline-name>.main --multirun num_client_per_round=5,10,50 dataset=femnist,cifar10
# the above command will run a total of 6 individual experiments (because 3client_configs x 2datasets = 6 -- you can think of it as a grid).

[Now show a figure/table displaying the results of the above command]

# add more commands + plots for additional experiments.
```
